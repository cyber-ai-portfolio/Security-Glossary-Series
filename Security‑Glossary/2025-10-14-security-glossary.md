## 📚 Networking & Security Vocabulary  

| Term | Definition | Emoji |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** | A network protocol used to map an IP address to the MAC address of the next router or device on the path. | 📡 |
| **Cloud‑based firewalls** | Software firewalls hosted by a cloud service provider rather than on‑premises hardware. | ☁️🛡️ |
| **Controlled zone** | A subnet that shields the internal network from the uncontrolled zone. | 🟢 |
| **Domain Name System (DNS)** | A networking protocol that translates human‑readable domain names into IP addresses. | 🌐 |
| **Encapsulation** | The process (often performed by a VPN) of wrapping sensitive data inside other data packets for protection. | 📦 |
| **Firewall** | A network security device that monitors and controls inbound/outbound traffic based on defined rules. | 🛡️ |
| **Forward proxy server** | A server that mediates a user’s outbound internet requests, often enforcing access policies. | ↗️ |
| **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** | An application‑layer protocol enabling communication between clients (browsers) and web servers. | 🌐 |
| **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** | HTTP layered with TLS/SSL to provide encrypted, secure communication between client and server. | 🔒🌐 |
| **IEEE 802.11 (Wi‑Fi)** | A family of standards defining wireless LAN communication (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, etc.). | 📶 |
| **Network protocols** | Rules that dictate how devices exchange data, covering ordering, formatting, and error handling. | 📜 |
| **Network segmentation** | A security technique that splits a larger network into isolated segments to limit lateral movement. | ✂️ |
| **Port filtering** | A firewall function that blocks or allows traffic based on specific port numbers. | 🚪 |
| **Proxy server** | A server that forwards client requests to other servers, often caching or filtering content. | 🔁 |
| **Reverse proxy server** | A server that sits in front of internal servers, handling inbound traffic and hiding backend details. | ↩️ |
| **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)** | A secure protocol for transferring files over a network, built on SSH. | 📁🔐 |
| **Secure Shell (SSH)** | A protocol that provides encrypted remote command‑line access to a host system. | 🖥️🔒 |
| **Security zone** | A network segment that isolates internal resources from external (internet) exposure. | 🏰 |
| **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** | A protocol for monitoring, configuring, and managing network devices. | 📊 |
| **Stateful firewall** | A firewall that tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on context. | 📈 |
| **Stateless firewall** | A firewall that applies static rule sets to each packet without tracking connection state. | 📉 |
| **Subnetting** | Dividing a larger IP network into smaller, logical sub‑networks (subnets). | 🗂️ |
| **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** | A connection‑oriented transport protocol that ensures reliable, ordered delivery of data. | 📬 |
| **Uncontrolled zone** | The part of a network that lies outside the organization’s trusted perimeter. | 🌍 |
| **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** | A service that encrypts traffic and routes it through a remote server, masking the user’s public IP. | 🛡️🌐 |
| **Wi‑Fi Protected Access (WPA)** | A set of security protocols (WPA/WPA2/WPA3) that protect wireless Wi‑Fi communications. | 🔐📶 |
