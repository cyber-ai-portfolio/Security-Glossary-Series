## 📚 Networking & Security Vocabulary  

| Term | Definition | Emoji |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Active packet sniffing** | A type of attack where data packets are **manipulated** while they’re in transit. | 🎣 |
| **Botnet** | A collection of computers infected by malware that are controlled by a single threat actor (the “bot‑herder”). | 🤖 |
| **Denial of service (DoS) attack** | An attack that overwhelms a network or server by flooding it with traffic, rendering it unavailable. | 🚫📡 |
| **Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack** | A DoS attack that leverages many compromised devices spread across different locations to amplify the traffic flood. | 🌐💥 |
| **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** | An Internet protocol used by devices to report transmission errors and other diagnostic information. | 📢 |
| **ICMP flood** | A DoS attack that repeatedly sends ICMP request packets to a server, exhausting its resources. | 🌊📨 |
| **IP spoofing** | An attack where the attacker falsifies the source IP address of a packet to masquerade as a trusted system. | 🪝 |
| **On‑path attack** | Also called a *man‑in‑the‑middle* attack; the adversary inserts themselves between two communicating parties to intercept or alter traffic. | ↔️🔓 |
| **Packet sniffing** | The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets traveling across a network. | 🕵️‍♂️ |
| **Passive packet sniffing** | An attacker connects to a network hub (or switch in monitor mode) and silently watches all traffic without modifying it. | 👀 |
| **Ping of death** | A DoS attack that sends an oversized ICMP echo request (> 64 KB) to crash or reboot vulnerable systems. | 💀📦 |
| **Replay attack** | An attacker records a valid data packet and later retransmits (or delays) it to deceive the receiver. | 🔁 |
| **Smurf attack** | An attacker spoofs a victim’s IP address and sends massive ICMP echo requests to a broadcast address, amplifying traffic back to the victim. | 🐘📡 |
| **SYN flood attack** | A DoS attack that abuses the TCP three‑way handshake by sending a flood of SYN packets, leaving the target with half‑open connections. | ⚡🔗 |
