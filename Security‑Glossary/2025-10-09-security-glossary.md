| **Prepare**   | The first step of the NIST RMF – activities needed to manage security and privacy risks *before* a breach occurs. | 🛡️ |
| **Categorize**| The second step – defines the impact levels of information systems to shape the risk‑management process.          | 📂 |
| **Select**    | The third step – choose, tailor, and document the security and privacy controls that will protect the organization. | 🎯 |
| **Implement** | The fourth step – actually deploy the selected security and privacy controls.                                      | 🏗️ |
| **Assess**    | The fifth step – verify that the controls have been implemented correctly and are functioning as intended.        | ✅ |
| **Authorize** | The sixth step – formally accept the residual security and privacy risks and grant an authority to operate (ATO). | 🛂 |
| **Monitor**   | The seventh step – continuously track the security state of the system and the effectiveness of the controls.     | 👀 |
